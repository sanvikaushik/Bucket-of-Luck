"Bucket of Luck" is a console-based application crafted in C, simulating a dice-based betting game. 
- Uses the rand() function for random dice roll simulation, ensuring unpredictable and fair game outcomes.
- The game initializes with a virtual wallet, prompting players to place bets on the result of dice rolls, either by choosing individual numbers or a range sum of multiple rolls.
- Conditional logic and loops to evaluate the player's bets against the dice outcomes, updating the wallet balance accordingly.
- The gameâ€™s user interface,  constructed using standard I/O functions (printf, scanf, getchar), dynamically displays dice outcomes and wallet balance.
